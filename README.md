# Machine Learning Jupyter Notebook Exercises

## Overview
This is a collection of several machine learning exercies I created as a teaching assistant for Professor David Anastasiu at Santa Clara University. <br/> 
Designed for graduate course COEN 240 - Machine Learning <br/>
The notebooks run out of the box giving a tutorial of each algorithm while addressing questions like 
- How does the math behind this work?
- When should I employ this?
- How do you adjust hyperparameters for better performance?

## SVM Notebook
This activity demonstrates using support vector machines (SVMs) with various example 2D datasets. The data is purposely two dimensional so that plots with the decision boundary can be visualized.

**Libraries:** sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib <br/>
**Data:** Adapted from a Stanford Machine Learning course [https://github.com/syaning/stanford-machine-learning/tree/master/machine-learning-ex6]

## LDA Notebook
This activity demonstrates using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for multi-class classification

**Libraries:** sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy <br/>
**Data:** Iris dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris]

## Ensemble Methods Notebook
This activity demonstrates two different types of ensemble methods, bagging and boosting

**Libraries:** sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy <br/>
**Data:** Sonar dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/undocumented/connectionist-bench/sonar/]
